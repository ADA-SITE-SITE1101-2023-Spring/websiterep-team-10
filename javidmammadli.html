      <h1>Javid Mammadli</h1>
      <p>My name is Javid Mammadli and I am studying Computer Science at ADA University. As a student, I am actively involved in various extracurricular activities that allow me to develop my skills and become a well-rounded individual.</p>
      <p>One of my passions is teamwork and cooperation. I believe that by working together, we can achieve great things. I believe that my leadership skills have been an asset in various projects that I have worked on, such as the Hour of Code and Website projects. Through these experiences, I have learned the importance of communication, organization, and delegation.</p>
      <p>In addition to my academic and extracurricular pursuits, I also enjoy playing basketball. I have been playing basketball since I was a child and have even played for my school's basketball team. I love the feeling of being on the court and the sense of companionship that comes with playing as part of a team. When I am not playing basketball, I enjoy researching a variety of topics, from technology to philosophy.</p>
      <p>I believe that learning new skills and expanding my knowledge is crucial to achieving success. That is why I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. Whether it's through taking online courses or attending workshops and conferences, I am constantly seeking ways to improve myself and my abilities.</p>
      <p>Overall, my days are filled with a variety of activities that challenge and inspire me. From attending classes and working on projects to playing basketball and learning new skills, I am always striving to be the best version of myself.</p>
