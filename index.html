         <h2>Hour of Code Event</h2>
         <p>The Hour of Code is a computer science event that aims to dispel the mystery surrounding "coding", establish that anyone can grasp the fundamentals, and promote greater engagement in the discipline. The event was organized by Team №10 on March 3, 2023, from 9:45 AM to 10:30 AM at the School №62 of Baku.
            The event was attended by 14 pupils of 6th grade. Working as a team, we employed all available resources and a variety of methods to ensure that the learning process was both educationally effective and engaging for the kids. The Hour of Code event in School №62 turned out to be a huge success, with pupils showing enthusiasm in programming concepts and ADA University. Many pupils expressed a desire to learn more about programming and to pursue it as a career in the future.
            Overall, the event was an excellent opportunity for pupils to learn about programming. Our team eagerly anticipates the opportunity to host similar events in the future, thereby continuing our efforts to provide valuable educational experiences for the community.
